# socketcan_hello

I place source code here while I read the SocketCAN readme file to understand how to use it.  
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/can.txt

I will start from hello_can.c which is a "hello world" program and eventually add more programs
as I go through the document and learn more features.
